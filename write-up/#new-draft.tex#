\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}

Tropical deforestation may contribute over 15\% of annual greenhouse
gas emissions. Any viable effort to mitigate climate change will have
to address deforestation.  International efforts to curb the rate of
deforestation have thus far been composed of a series bilateral
agreements, despite calls for a comprehensive, global mechanism.  The
United Nations has proposed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation
and Degradation (REDD) framework to directly address local incentives
to convert forest to fiscally productive lands.  This grand Coasian
bargain, however, has been frustrated by many factors, including high
transaction costs, discord among member countries, and poorly defined
property rights.  The number of frustrating factors is an increasing
function of the number of relevant member countries.  The devil is in
the details, and the amount of details rises exponentially with the
number of contracting agents.  As with any network graph, the number
of edges increases exponentially with the number of nodes.  The UN
REDD framework is effectively an attempt to consolidate negotiations;
but this effort has met limited success due in part to a constantly
shifting natural and political landscape for forest conservation.\\

This paper demonstrates that the basis for a comprehensive agreement
is becoming more complex.  Specifically, this paper utilizes satellite
imagery to show that the dispersion of forest clearing across
administrative units is increasing.  The number of countries with a
substantial share of forest clearing activities is increasing,
potentially forestalling a truly comprehensive conservation framework.  

\section*{Forest clearing detection}
\label{sec-2}

The data on forest clearing activity is based on the classification of
stacked images from the Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) sensor aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites.  Both time
series and cross-sectional characteristics are extracted from the
images, and then compared against historical (2000-2005) forest cover
loss data (Hansen, 2008).  The classification rule is derived from the
comparison, and then applied forward to more recent imagery.  The
final output is a probability of forest cover loss between January 1,
2000 and the acquisition date of the most recent MODIS imagery.  The
resulting alerts are highly accurate when compared against other,
production-level forest clearing alerts.  A notable result is that a
relatively simple algorithm can produce reasonably accurate alerts,
especially to capture broad trends in forest clearing activity.

The algorithm to collect forest clearing alerts consists of four
principal steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time series characteristics from the derived Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) are extracted for each 500-meter pixel in
   the humid tropics (MOD13A1).  These characteristics include
   long-term trends and variation in the NDVI, along with short-term
   break detection.  The techniques are common in time series
   econometrics, often in the context of financial indices.  The
   established econometric techniques are repurposed to account for
   natural cycles.
\item Cross-sectional methods are employed on derived images to identify
   clusters of the extracted time dependent characteristics.  This
   includes, for example, the largest detected drop in the NDVI series
   for a cluster of pixels.  The largest, neighborhood drop is
   ascribed as a pixel-level characteristic, acting as a smoothing
   operator across the image, much like a moving average over time.
\item The pixel-level attributes from the time series and cross-sectional
   analysis are compared against historical data on forest cover loss.
   The precise method of comparison is a logistic, ridge classifier,
   implemented in parallel to accommodate very large, distributed
   data.
\item The classification rule is applied to the most recent MODIS imagery
   for each ecoregion to produce a probability of forest cover loss.
   The probability can be interpreted as a measure of \emph{strength
   of signal} of clearing activity.  There is substantial noise via
   measurement error or cloud cover, which may mask the spectral
   signals associated with forest conversion.  The continuous index
   rises as the signal of forest cover loss persists over time.  
\end{enumerate}

The precise algorithm, along with detailed documentation, is stored as
an open source repository, with a growing number of contributors.  The
final output can be fully replicated; every minor step, of which there
are many, is open for public review.  The result is a highly accurate
alerting system of forest cover loss in the humid tropics.  There is
limited number of publicly available and high quality images for
validation.  The two primary data sets are (1) the forest cover loss
hotspots data that serves as the training data set, and (2) the annual
deforestation data in Brazil, released by the national institute for
space research (INPE).  The data set, called PRODES, reports the
boundaries of deforestation for the years 2000 through 2010.  This
third-party data offers reliable, albeit spatially limited,
information on annual land cover change on which to base accuracy
assessments, as used by Townshend \emph{et al.} (2004).  In line with
this simple overlay, the following table compares the PRODES data
against both the final output and the pan-tropical training data set.
The comparison is limited to the spatial extent of the PRODES data.

\section*{Dispersion}
\label{sec-3}

The alerts are aggregated into three levels of administrative units:
country, province, and sub-province.  These units correspond to levels
0, 1, and 2, respectively, in the Global Administrative boundaries
(GADM) data.  The aggregated alerts can be aggregated by a simple
count, a sum of probabilities, or a combination of the two.  Each
method offers a slightly different view onto the data.  Here, we offer
only the simple count, but the full set of results is offered on the
companion code repository, which serves as a robustness check for the
reported results.  Specifically, an alert is identified when the
probability of forest cover loss exceeds a pre-defined confidence
threshold.  A natural threshold is 50\%, as it represents the steepest
point on the logistic function, which underlies the classification
rule.  The 50\% threshold is easily defensible and defines the alerts,
which are aggregated for each administrative unit and for each 16-day
interval.

  \caption{Pan-tropical Rate}
  \label{fig:global}
\end{figure}

The pantropical rate of industrial-scale forest clearing alerts are
reported in Figure \ref{fig:global}.  The seasonality of tropical
alerts is clear; and through the seasonality, so too is the upward
trend of forest clearing activity.  Equally pertinent to a
comprehensive conservation framework, however, is the spatial
distribution of the clearing activity.  A common measure of dispersion
is the normalized Shannon Entropy measure (citation needed). A value
of 1 indicates pure entropy or dispersion, associated with a uniform
distribution across units.  Alternatively, a value of 0 indicates that
the frequency distribution consists of a single value: no dispersion
at all.  



Let $i$ be the pixel index, and $j$ be the set of pixel indices in
administrative unit $j$. The aggregate level of clearing activity in
administrative unit $j$ and time period $t$ is given by Equation
(\ref{eq:aggregation}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:aggregation}
D_{jt} = \sum_{i \in C_j} \I (p_{it} \geq 0.5) \cdot p_{it}
\end{equation}

We characterize the spread of clearing activity across all
administrative units in the sample by using Shannon's entropy
criterion, defined in equation Y.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:entropy}
E_{t} = -\sum_{j = 1}^{n} \frac{D_{jt}}{D_t} \log_{2} \frac{D_{jt}}{D_t} \with D_{t} = \sum_j D_{jt}
\end{equation}

E ranges from 0 to 1, and larger values of E indicate higher
dispersion across units.  A value of 1 is a uniform distribution, with
equal values for all units.
